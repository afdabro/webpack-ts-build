## FAQ

### Where can I find a simple example of how to use the build package?
The [Examples](https://github.com/afdabro/webpack-ts-build/tree/master/examples) page covers how to configure a default webpack, setup a build, and use the development server.

### Why is the code coverage so low? 
Well, a majority of the code is configuration-driven which does not lend itself well to unit tests.
